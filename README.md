# Homework 07 - Good README Generator!

## Description
This app was made using node.js running in the integrated terminal of VSCode. The purpose of creating this was to design a way to make quick and readable README's.
The running app will prompt the user to input answers throughout a series of several questions. We now have the information required to construct a readme file. 
This app compiles the responses and formats them into a finished markdown file.

# User Story

## Installation
Having VSCode installed, navigate to the following webiste: [https://nodejs.org/en/].
Download the installer reccomended for "most users".
Upon completion, open your VSCode, create a new document called "index.js".
Right click on this file/folder and click "Open in integrated terminal".
Upon clicking this, you are greeted with a popup at the bottom of VSCode, here we will type:
"npm install" and hit enter. 

## Usage
Upon this completing, we next type; "node index.js".
This will begin to run the generator app, prompting the user with questions.
When all questions have been answered, you will be returned to the terminal resting state.
Look to your left-side of VSCode, you should have a new file called "NewReadme.md"!
Congrats you made your first readme with ease! Edit further using markdown.
